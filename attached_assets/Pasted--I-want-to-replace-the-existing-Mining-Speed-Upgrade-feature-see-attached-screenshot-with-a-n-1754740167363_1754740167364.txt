

I want to replace the existing “Mining Speed Upgrade” feature (see attached screenshot) with a new upgraded feature as follows:

New Packages & Benefits:
Bronze – $3

200% faster token mining

Silver – $14

600% faster token mining

Golden – $55

3000% faster token mining

Diamond – $100

6000% faster token mining

Common Benefits for all packages:

Increase your booster buy %

Entitled to profit-sharing benefit in PALL every month

Referral commissions:

F1 (First referral) = 5%

F2 (Referral’s referral) = 2.5%

No KYC required

Additional benefits to enhance user experience

Important Conditions:

A package can only be purchased once per user (same package cannot be purchased again, but a different package can be purchased)

User must connect their Web3 crypto wallet to purchase a package

Payment must be made in USDT (BNB Smart Chain) only

Payment is sent to my MetaMask wallet; once payment is confirmed, the package is activated

My MetaMask wallet details must be kept secure

Referral Commission Logic:

F1 commission (5%) in USDT is credited to the referrer’s wallet immediately after the package is purchased

F2 commission (2.5%) in USDT is credited to the first referral’s wallet immediately after the package is purchased

UI Changes Required:
Menu Bar

Move the 3-line menu icon from right to left side

Add Home and Wallet options in the menu

Wallet Screen

At the top, add two buttons:

Withdraw (on click → show “Coming Soon”)

Deposit (on click → show “Coming Soon”)

Display:

User’s mined PALL coin balance

Referral commission in USDT

Transaction history for both PALL and USDT

Profile Screen

Allow users to upload and save their profile picture

Please update all related backend and frontend code to ensure smooth functioning, integrate the Web3 wallet connection for payments, and make the UI changes as described above.
Ensure all wallet transactions and MetaMask wallet details are secure.
